### About Me

Hi I'm Nick!

I'm a Fragment Developer at APT Solutions, using bespoke 'Fragments' framework to develop CMS and CRM websites for not-for-profit organisations such as Trade Unions, Sporting Bodies, Institutions, Societies, Health Cash Plans, and Associations.

I've always had an interest in computers and technology (mostly through the lens of gaming!), and coded my first website way back in 2006. I'd dabbled with bits and pieces since then but in 2021 I made the decision to switch careers after working in retail for 12 years, and began studying a Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Institute. In August 2022 I began my first tech role with APT Solutions.

When I'm not coding, I try to spend as much time as I can with the other things I love in my life - my family (my wife and three boys), my books (I'm an avid reader) and my miniatures (I've collected, painted and played Warhammer since I was 10!)
